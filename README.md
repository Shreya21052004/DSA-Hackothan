# E-commerce Platform with Recommendation System

## Overview
This project aims to design and implement an e-commerce platform that includes a robust recommendation system. The system generates personalized product suggestions for users based on their browsing and purchase history. The goal is to enhance the user experience and promote relevant products by analyzing user interactions with the platform.

## Requirements
- Personalized product recommendations based on user browsing and purchase history.
- Provide relevant product suggestions to users to enhance their shopping experience.
- Use at least two different data structures, including at least one non-linear data structure (e.g., Graphs or Trees).

### Data Structures Used
1. **Hash Tables**: For fast lookups of user and product data.
2. **Graphs or Trees**: For managing the recommendation logic and relationships between products and users (Non-Linear Data Structure).

## System Components
1. **User Management**: Handle user registration, login, and profile management.
2. **Product Management**: Manage product information, categories, and inventory.
3. **Browsing History Tracker**: Track and store user browsing history.
4. **Purchase History Tracker**: Track and store user purchase history.
5. **Recommendation Engine**: Analyze browsing and purchase data to generate personalized recommendations.

## Operations Needed
To efficiently manage these components, the system should support the following operations:
- **Add User**: Register a new user.
- **Add Product**: Add a new product to the catalog.
- **Track Browsing History**: Record user interactions with products.
- **Track Purchase History**: Record user purchases.
- **Generate Recommendations**: Suggest products to users based on their history.
- **Retrieve User Data**: Access user data for personalized experiences.
- **Retrieve Product Data**: Access product data for displaying recommendations.
